Hello and good morning. I have completed the task. All functionality has been completed.  Here are the screenshots and my Github link: https://github.com/codeLoverX/employee-attendance-app.
1) I have used MySQL Database for the database. 
2) I placed the CSV file under the main/resources/static/ folder and named it as "CSVSheet1.csv". Column names must be the same, too
3) Time can be inputted in the human friendly format "hh::mm a" such as "03:00 am" format, but don't add seconds, only hours and minutes please. 

If you have any questions, please let me know. \
Thank you! Regards,\
Ridwan Bin Monjur
